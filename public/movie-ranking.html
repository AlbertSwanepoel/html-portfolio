 <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Who knew Stephen King could write brilliant but inspiring prison drama?</p>
<h3>Baby Driver</h3>

And the opening car chase will remain the benchmark for others to be measured against for years to come!</p>
<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>Mexican all-round maestro Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece of good vs. evil, achieved through a brilliant and fantastic journey of a young girl - a mesmerising fantasy through a mystical labyrinth.</p>
